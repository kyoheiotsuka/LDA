# Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

Implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using variational Bayesian inference is provided in this class.
For details on LDA, please refer to the original paper Blei et al. (2003) and/or wikipedia.

## Sample Code

Sample code is available for applying LDA and extracting topics from synthetically generated data.
Figures below show the obtained results after observing 1000 synthetically generated data.
