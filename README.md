# Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

Implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using variational Bayesian inference is provided in this class.
For details on LDA, please refer to the original paper [Blei et al. (2003)](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/BleiNgJordan2003.pdf) and/or article on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation).

## Sample Code

Sample code is available for applying LDA and extracting topics from synthetically generated data.
Figures below show the obtained results after observing 1000 synthetically generated data.
